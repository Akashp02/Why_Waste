# Why Waste

### This project is aimed at decreasing hunger in the country.

## About:
- This project provides a site using which people can donate food to all the registered NGOs.
- There is a `Give Meal` button using which the donator can enter his details, and the amount of Food available.
- Now this form data will go to all the registered NGOs.
- Then the NGOs can contact that particular donate and get the food from him.

## Run:
- You can run directly by opening the `newproject.html` file.
- As of now, NodeJS is not added to the project.

## Features:
- Currently, we are just taking the details of all the NGOs and storing them in the backend.

## Features to be added:
- Whenever the user submits the form, this form data should be broadcasted to all the NGOs present in the list. We are still working on implementing this.

## Future Implementations:
- We don't want to restrict this only to food.
- In future, we are trying to build a site where people can donate everything starting from left-over food to old clothes.
- In this way we are trying to remove poverty in the country.
